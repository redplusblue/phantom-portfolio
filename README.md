## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Phantom Portfolio follows a decoupled architecture:

1. **Frontend**: A single-page application (SPA) built with React.js, offering a responsive and interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: A RESTful API developed with Flask, handling data processing, authentication, and external API interactions.
3. **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM for structured data storage, with models for Users and Transactions.
4. **Caching**: Redis for efficient token management and improved performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- Redis server

   ```

2. Set up the frontend:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the backend:

   ```
